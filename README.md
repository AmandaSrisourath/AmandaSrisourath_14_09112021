# Convert a jQuery library to React

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Getting started
In the project directory, you can run:

```
npm start
```

```
npm test
```

## What did I do

1. Conversion of the HRNet project
- New version of the "Create Employee" and "Employee List" pages with React.
- Added a state management system.
- Make sure everything is consistent in style.
- Test the React code with a unit test suite.

2. Conversion of drop-down menus
- Publishing the [React component](https://www.npmjs.com/package/basic-react-dropdown) on npm as a package 

3. Performance tests with Lighthouse
