# Convert a jQuery library to React

## What did I do

1. Conversion of the HRNet project
- New version of the "Create Employee" and "Employee List" pages with React.
- Added a state management system.
- Make sure everything is consistent in style.
- Test the React code with a unit test suite.

2. Conversion of drop-down menus
- Publishing the [React component](https://www.npmjs.com/package/basic-react-dropdown) on npm as a package
